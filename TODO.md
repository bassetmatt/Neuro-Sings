# TODO
## High-prio
- [ ] Add ARG songs, as a separate preset
  - [ ] Find dates
- [ ] Add roundabout from 1st subathon


## Mid-prio
- [ ] Replace github screenshots with poweramp?
- [ ] Preset prefix/suffix (pass preset to Song)
- [ ] More complex flag selection with AND/OR
  - [ ] Maybe at first just an option in the preset to tell include-type = "AND" | "OR" (same for exclude). Write stack_and function and check for option in preset.
  - [ ] Or have a "complex mode" flag, tell if it's AND->OR or OR->AND. And put conditions in arrays of arrays and apply operation 1 between level1 arrays...
- [x] Find where "fnaf.mp3" is from -> unused
